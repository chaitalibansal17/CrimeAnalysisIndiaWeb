<h1 style="color:#800000; font-size:32px"  align="center" > DATA</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px">The Data for crime has been taken from the site of <a href="http://ncrb.nic.in/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0,0,0)"><b>National Crime Record Bureau</b></a>. These crimes are as per the Indian Penal Code which is the main criminal code of India.
The crime data can also be downloaded in PDF form for different year from <a href="http://ncrb.gov.in/StatPublications/CII/PrevPublications.htm" style="color: rgb(0,0,0)" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br><br>
The data for literacy rate, Sex ratio, Urban population and Rural Population was taken from the <b>Census of 2001</b> and <b>Census of 2011</b> which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/bazuka/census2001" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0,0,0)"> here(2001)</a> and <a href="http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011-Common/CensusData2011.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0,0,0)"> here(2011)</a>.
<br><br>
The data for Police Strength is taken from the <a href="http://bprd.nic.in/" target="_blank"  style="color: rgb(0,0,0)"><b>Bureau of Police Research and Development</b></a>.The data can be downloaded from <a href="http://bprd.nic.in/WriteReadData/userfiles/file/201607121235174125303FinalDATABOOKSMALL2015.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0,0,0)">here</a>.
 <br><br>
 Here is the data we collected to use for our project.<a href="crimeagainstwomen_files\sheet001.htm" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0,0,0) ">(click)</a>
 
 <br><br>
 One of the major drawback of the data is that the crime data released by Government is the number of crimes recorded whereas there is huge gap in the numbers of incendence of crime, crimes reported and the crimes that have been recorded.
